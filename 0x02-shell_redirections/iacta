Alea iacta est (The die cast) is a variation of a Latin phrase attributed by Suitonius to Julius Ceasar in the 49 BC
as he led his army across the Rubicon river in Norther Italy. 
He entered Italy at the head of his army in defiance of the senate and began his long civil war against Pompey and Optimates. 
The phrase either, in original Latin or in translation, is used in many languages to indicate that events have passed 
to a point of no return. It is now commonly cited with the word order changed 
("Alea iacta est") rather than in the original phrasing.
